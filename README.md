## Laboratory in Neuroanatomy

The content of this page is maintained by [Franco Pestilli](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/fp4834) on [GitHub](https://github.com/francopestilli/neuroanat-class/edit/main/README.md).

This virtual lab in neuroanatomy is subdivided into different sections. The early sections focus on anatomical strcutre, terms and organization. Later strcutres focus on the role that some of the structures play in human cognition, perception and disease.

### The brain from the outside: Overview of the brain cortex and white matter.

#### The brain cortex.
The modl



#### The brain subcortical connective structures and white matter. 
The model shows portions of the corona radiata, Inferior Fronto Occipital Fasciculus (IFOF), and Uncinate. The strcutres are not labeled.

Another view of the subcortical strcutres and white matter. This specimen shows the optic radiation (connecting the Superior Lateral Geniculate in the Thalamus with the Visual cortex in the Occipiatl Lobe).

This view shows a variety of limbic Structures with appropriate labels.

### The brain from the outside: The Meninges – Dura Mater, Arachnoid the Subarachnoid space.

The 3D model below shows the brain cortex partially wrapped in the brain meniges (Dura Mater and Ararchnoid).

The 3D model below shows the brain cortex partially wrapped in the Ararchnoid. The right hemisphere is still wrapped, the left hemisphere has been freed of the meninges.
